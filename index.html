      <p>â€œAny fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it.Programmers are mostly "learn by doing" types. No amount of academic study or watching other people code can compare to breaking open an editor and start making mistakes." </p>
